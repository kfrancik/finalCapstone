    <h2>Hi, my name is Kate.</h2>
        
            <p>I have always believed that the true meaning of a thing can be found in the details. 
               As a life-long lover of handmade crafts, one of the most exciting things for me is to try and capture that beautiful spark of character in each piece I create. 
               For me, a seemingly small piece of jewellery can hide hidden meaning in its intricacies.</p>
            <p>As a lover of minimalism, but also a person who loves to highlight her individuality, 
               the making and wearing of unique handmade jewellery has become a great way to express myself.</p>   
            <p>I agree with Elizabeth Taylor:</p>
            
            <blockquote cite="https://fortuneandframe.com/blogs/news/jewelry-quotes">
                "Jewelry has the power to be the one little thing that makes you feel unique." 
            </blockquote>

            <p>I believe there are more women like me, and I create my jewellery for them because I know that less is more and the detail matters.</p>

            <h2>How I create my jewellery</h2>
            <h3>Inspiration is first</h3>
            <p>Inspiration can come from anywhere: wildlife, a good book, a movie, music, architecture. 
               Sometimes, is it a colour, an interesting stone or some fleeting impression…</p>

            <h3>Design is next</h3>
            <p>Occasionally I draft my design on paper, but generally, I prefer to gather the materials I would like to use and let the idea come together in my head.</p>

            <h3>And finally, Execution</h3>
            <p>I create my jewellery using two techniques: soutache embroidery and bead embroidery, which I often combine into a single piece. 
               Both are very delicate and require a lot of patience, but the result is well worth the effort!</p>  
            <p>I started my adventure with creating soutache jewellery in 2012. I saw photos of other authors’ works and they charmed me. I decided to try. 
               It was a fascinating challenge, especially as there were very few tutorials at that time. The only thing left for me was trial and error. 
               Although the first pendant was far from perfect, soutache seduced me. 
               Today I cheat on the soutache technique from time to time for beaded or resin jewellery, but I always keep coming back to my first love.</p>
